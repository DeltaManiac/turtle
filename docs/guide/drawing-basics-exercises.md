**Congratulations!** You made it through the first section of this course! You
should now have a basic grasp of many different programming concepts. There is
plenty more to learn and we will introduce you to all of it throughout the rest
of these lessons.

TODO: Fun image!

If you still don't feel confident about any of the concepts you learned so far,
please don't hesitate to re-read the section you had trouble with, do the
exercises to help clarify the concepts, or [reach out for help][help]!

## Section Exercises

These exercises are designed to help you check your understanding of the concepts
covered so far. Just like with any other exercises throughout the course, feel
free to skip these and come back to them later if you need to.

* Modify the circle example to draw the circle to the left of the turtle's
  starting point, not the right (provide starting code)
* Make the circle bigger or smaller
* Try to use a value less than 360 in the loop to see what happens
* Draw two circles beside each other
* Draw boxes that intersect (show picture of desired result)
* Advanced: draw the Olympic rings (show picture of desired result--no colors)
* Advanced: create a function that can accept any radius or diameter and produce
  that size of circle (you will need pi, and possibly sqrt, etc.)
* Try to draw a triangle (hint: lookup the angles on a search engine if you
  don't know them already)
