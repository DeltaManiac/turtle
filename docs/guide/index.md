Welcome! This guide is written with complete beginners in mind. That
means that **no programming experience is required whatsoever** in order to
follow this guide. Throughout the guide, you will slowly be introduced to Rust
concepts that will both teach you more programming and help you draw more
advanced pictures with turtle!

If you are new to programming, you should start with the
[**What is Programming?**]({% link guide/what-is-programming.md %}) section of the
course.

## Experienced Programmers

If you are an experienced programmer, or if you already know Rust, you can still
use this guide. Just skim over or skip the sections that you already know. Many
of the topics elaborated on are specifically to explain things to people with no
experience, so reading those may feel a bit redundant at times.

Start learning here: [**Getting Started**]({% link guide/getting-started.md %})

## Getting Help

Learning something new can be challenging, so it is really important to know
what to do when you need help!

TODO: Getting Help!

The following resources should help you learn what you need:

* [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/){:target="_blank"} - If you are new to the Rust programming language
* [Turtle Examples](https://github.com/sunjay/turtle/tree/master/examples){:target="_blank"} - Creative examples of how to use the crate for drawing things from basic shapes to colorful masterpieces, and even the logo of the Rust programming language!
  * **How you can help:** Create and contribute examples! Open a PR on the Turtle
    GitHub repository so we can add your example to the repository!
* [The Turtle API Documentation](https://docs.rs/turtle){:target="_blank"} - The drawing
  functions and most of the rest of the crate is well documented
  * **How you can help:** Add examples and better descriptions to anything you
    think could use some more documentation
